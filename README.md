<h1>API Documentation for Financial Insights and Scoring</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This API is built using Flask to expose the financial scoring model. It accepts financial transaction data, processes it, and returns a financial score along with insights.</p>

<h2>Endpoints</h2>
<ol>
<b>1. /api/calculate_score</b>
  <ul>
Method: POST
Description: Processes financial transaction data and calculates a financial score with recommendations.
Request Payload:
transactionData (JSON): A list of transactions for a family, each containing details like income, expenses, savings, and category distributions.
    </ul>
</ol>
***Key Components***

Flask Framework:

Used to create the API.
Provides a lightweight and extensible framework for web applications.
Flask-CORS:

Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing the API to be accessed from web applications hosted on different domains.
Logic Layer (process_financial_data):

The core function that processes the input data, calculates financial scores, and generates recommendations.
Implemented in the model.py file.
Implementation Highlights
Error Handling:

Wrapped in a try-except block to handle unexpected issues gracefully.
Returns detailed error messages to assist debugging.
Debugging and Logging:

Includes print statements for debugging to log incoming data and results.
Modularity:

Separation of concerns between the API (app.py) and core logic (model.py), ensuring maintainability and scalability.


***Deployment Instructions***

1. Ensure Python and Flask are installed:
pip install flask flask-cors

2. Run the API:
python app.py


Access the API locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/calculate_score.
